# My Resume with React PDF ðŸ“‘

I've used [Enhancv](https://enhancv.com) to build my resumes ðŸ¥°
([see my enhancv doc](https://github.com/rqbazan/my-resume-with-react-pdf/blob/1532b26f7756d16151b7c19a051ddb8d614474ba/docs/by-enhancv.pdf)),
it's an awesome tool, really easy to use. But, in order to save some money ðŸ’¸, I
decided to build my own resume. ðŸ’¯

### Objetives

- [x] Use [ReactPDF](https://react-pdf.org/) to build the document.
- [x] Use my beautiful Enhancv theme as inspiration.
- [x] Support dynamic content from external service.
- [x] Support internationalization.
